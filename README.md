AJAX, JSON &amp; Promises and more — Learning Repo
# AJAX, JSON & Promises — Learning Repo

A personal collection for learning and reusing patterns around AJAX, JSON, and Promises in modern JavaScript.

TL;DR
- Yes, make a focused repo. Keep examples, exercises, demos, and notes in clear folders.
- Prefer a single well-organized repo (or one per language/domain) rather than one repo per tiny snippet.
- Include runnable examples, small exercises, and short READMEs per example.

Suggested repository name ideas
- ajax-json-promises
- async-web-examples
- web-async-playground

Why a dedicated repo?
- Centralized learning artifacts: examples, exercises, and cheatsheets.
- Reusable code for future projects.
- Easier to version and share with others or use in interviews/portfolio.

Repository structure (recommended)
- README.md                 — top-level overview and index
- LICENSE
- .gitignore
- docs/                     — short notes, concepts, diagrams
- examples/
  - fetch-basic/
  - fetch-async-await/
  - axios/
  - json-server-demo/
- src/                      — reusable utility functions
- exercises/                — small tasks with instructions and expected output
- demos/                    — HTML pages you can open locally / GitHub Pages
- tests/                    — unit tests (Jest / Mocha) for utilities
- tools/                    — scripts for running JSON Server or demo servers

How to use the repo
- Clone it, open the examples in your browser or run node for server-side examples.
- Keep each example self-contained with a README that explains the goal and expected behavior.
- Add `example.html` files so non-module demos are easy to open.

Starter learning path (suggested)
1. Understand fetch() basics and handling response.json().
2. Learn Promises: .then(), .catch(), Promise.all/any/race.
3. Move to async/await and error handling patterns.
4. Work with AbortController and timeouts.
5. Use JSON Server, mock APIs, or Postman to test responses and CORS.
6. Try real-world examples: form submit, pagination, infinite scroll, file upload.

Best practices to show in examples
- Always check response.ok and handle non-2xx HTTP codes.
- Use try/catch around async/await.
- Show how to cancel requests with AbortController.
- Demonstrate concurrency patterns (Promise.all, throttling).
- Keep examples small and focused; include expected output.

Tools and extras to include
- json-server for a local mock API
- simple Node/Express mock backend for CORS demos
- Postman/Insomnia collections
- VS Code workspace settings (optional)
- Minimal tests for important utility functions

Branching & versioning tips
- Use main (or master) as default; create branches for features or exercises.
- Tag releases if you want to snapshot learning milestones.
- Use issues to track TODO exercises or ideas.

Publishing / sharing
- Use GitHub Pages for demo HTML pages (demos/).
- Use Gists for single-file shareable snippets.
- If a utility grows into reusable code, consider publishing to npm.

License
- Use MIT for a personal snippet repo so you can freely reuse and share.

Example quick-start (CLI)
```bash
# create repo locally and push
mkdir ajax-json-promises && cd ajax-json-promises
git init
# add files from this template, commit, create repo on GitHub, add origin, push
```

Keep it simple: start with 4–6 focused examples and expand as you learn.
